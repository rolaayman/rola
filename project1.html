            <h2>BASEL HELAL ...</h2>
            <p>I am Basel Helal, a passionate filmmaker. I always had the passion of creating stories, and I’ve always used visual methods as in short films and videos to tell stories. Yet I always wanted to try writing as another method of creating, so I took the chance to start right away.</p>
            <p>Since I was young, I always loved all kinds of adventure. And most probably it’s all because of Dad who made me play sports since my early ages. So to me trying out those activities takes away any anxious feelings or stressful thoughts out of my mind. Everyone in this life is going through something probably no one will ever know a thing about. Seeking something new is always a way to take away some of those horrible parts of life.</p><br>

             <h2>GIFTED NEW MOON ... </h2>
            <p>I always look at those who write books and wonder how do they do it? Is it even possible? I started Gifted New Moon at first without having the intention to publish it. It was all draft thoughts in the beginning, written on paper. Then one day I decided that this might be a book. So, I searched a lot on how to make a book. It was quite challenging for me since I had no experience on how the book industry works. Starting with which font should I use? How about the book design? The cover? Should I create it on my own? How do I know the size of the cover? What’s an ISBN? How do I publish a book? I had many questions that frustrated me, yet when I took each step on its own it became easier and now, I understand it more.</p>
